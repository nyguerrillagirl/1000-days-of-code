### Day 302: July 25, 2025 (Friday)
- COMMENT
  - It seems all the technical books have terrible chapter 1's. The Advanced FE Dev
    had too many React examples and concepts that are just too much for a beginner. The
    book Pandas in Action did the same thing - all this Jupyter Notebook code. I know,
    I know, you told the reader to read Appendix A. The final book Dive Into Data Science
    seems to be in the same spirit. I am not sure if the authors are trying to turn people off or what.
    I held my own and actually felt like - okay a good review since I have been taking
    Datacamp courses and Coursera React courses for months now. I don't understand why chapter 1 for the React
    should not have been just a history of responsive design and even a note on how we are moving away
    from frameworks or simplier ones. 
- NOTE FOR THE DAY:
  - TBD
- Data Camp [DS]
  - Practice:
    - Functions and Packages
    - Introduction to Importing Data in Python
    - Python Lists
  - Introduction to Statistics in Python
- Coursera Working on course 7/9 [Principles of UX/UI Design] in  [Meta Front-End Specialization]
  - Working on Module 3 for  Course 7/9 - Prinicples of UX/UI Design              
- Books
  - Tech Reading
    - Data Science Books
      - Pandas in Action
    	  - Completed reading chapter 1/14
        - This chapter is quite a bit for a beginner. How to set up Jupyter Notebook
          is in the appendix.  I followed along because I have Anaconda Prompt 
          set up and ready to go because of my Datacamp work. As a first chapter this 
          should have been so much shorter and get into the power of pandas in the
          subsequent chapters. Are authors trying to scare folks away?
      - Dive Into Data Science
        - Reading Chapter 1
      - Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit Learn
     - Advanced Front-End Development
      - Reading Chapter 1 - Introduction to React
        - Complted
        - This book is supposed to be for beginners to advanced but the very first
          chapter with code that I am sure someone never seeing React components would
          be lost to understand.  I understand since reading this book is a review of
          all the React I learned from the Coursera FE course. I am hoping it adds to my knowledge
          since certain key topics (e.g. Routing) were not covered in the course!
          I think the authors should re-think this first chapter, covering JSX, hooks, etc. 
          can be overwhelming for a beginner.
