|Date       |   Description |
|7/24/2025  |I decided to start a new repo to start the next 700 days of code.|
|           |This holds material on courses I am taking (will now include notes) + projects|
|           |I will try to create PDF files for all the Microsoft Word document I create. The|
|           |Word documents have the advantage of being able to display animated gifs!| 
|	    |My goal will be to start and complete all coursera courses and datacamp|


# GOAL #1: Complete all current Coursera courses
- Meta Frontend Developer
- Google Cybersecurity
- Software Engineering

# GOAL #2: Learning Data Science
- Datacamp courses, taking all courses in the Associate Data Scientist in Python

# Goal #3: Book Club
- Tech Reading
- Non-tech Reading

I decided to move some of the documentation I create as part of the 300-days-of-code 
under Github.  I usually have them saved in OneDrive but I got a corrupt file which
made me lose one day of notes.

# BACKLOG:
